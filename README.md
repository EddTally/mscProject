#Abstract from Dissertation
The project undertaken creates an open-source development environment in Unity, this allows for anyone with a 360◦ video and a HTC Vive device to download from the GitHub, a repository containing a Unity project for them to experience an encompassing 360◦ video experience with two 180◦ composite screen monitors displayed on-top for multiple video viewing. This dissertation contains the documentation required to understand and recreate a partly open-source pipeline that consists of acquiring 360◦ video content, a suggested program for stitching 360◦ videos together and ﬁnally viewing them within the aforementioned VR integrated Unity development environment created. Findings from research conducted show the importance, potential usefulness and willingness of lecturers to integrating VR (Virtual Reality) into the teaching of medical students.
